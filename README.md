## 🔍 Key Insights
- The company’s overall attrition rate is high (>15%), signaling potential retention challenges.
- Sales and HR (female) employees have the highest attrition, suggesting workload or limited growth opportunities.
- Laboratory Technicians show the highest attrition among job roles.
- Employees aged 18–25 leave most often, likely due to early-career transitions.
- Departments with lower job satisfaction have higher attrition, confirming satisfaction’s strong link to retention.
- Lower-salary employees tend to leave more frequently.
- Employees with Life Sciences and Medical education show higher attrition, likely due to wider job mobility.
- For males, job satisfaction rises with better work-life balance (highest at rating 4).
  For females, satisfaction peaks at rating 2, suggesting other factors like career growth or role engagement may influence satisfaction more than balance alone.
- Attrition rises for employees living 11–27 km away, suggesting commute distance affects turnover.
- 75% of employees who left were doing overtime, highlighting workload concerns.
- Male attrition slightly higher than female — possibly due to lower average pay and longer overtime hours.

## 💡 Business Recommendations

- Strengthen engagement programs for young employees (age 18–25).
- Improve compensation or recognition for lower-salary groups.
- Encourage flexible work arrangements to enhance satisfaction.
